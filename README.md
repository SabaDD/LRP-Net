The codes for our proposed deep learning-based computational model, which aims to capture the developing asymmetry over longitudinal screening mammogram examinations for breast cancer risk prediction, are stored in this repository. The model was published in the Pattern Recognition journal under the title "Deep learning of longitudinal mammogram examinations for breast cancer risk prediction".
